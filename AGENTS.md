# AGENTS.md

Follow the repository documentation.

Start with:

1. `README.md` - project purpose, setup, and usage
2. `CONTRIBUTING.md` - contribution standards, scope, code quality, testing,
   security, dependencies, commits, and review expectations

If this template is being copied or cloned into another repository, read
`.agents/ADOPTION.md` before changing existing project documentation.

## Additional Context

Check these root-level documents when they are present and relevant:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - system structure, boundaries, data flow, and major technical decisions
- `DESIGN.md` - product UX, design system, theming, and branding rules
- `SECURITY.md` - security policy, privacy rules, sensitive data handling, and audit expectations
- `API.md` - public API, automation, OAuth, MCP, and integration contracts
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - hosting, runtime targets, environment configuration, and release notes
- `DOMAIN_MODEL.md` - durable domain concepts, entities, relationships, and rules
- `EXTENSIONS.md` - extension strategy, plugin boundaries, hooks, and customer extension rules

Keep project knowledge in normal documentation files. Do not introduce
assistant-specific folders or tool-only instruction files unless they are
explicitly part of the project setup.

## Agentic Work Area

Operational planning for AI-assisted development lives in `.agents/`.

Before asking what to do next, check `.agents/NEXT.md` and
`.agents/WORKFLOW.md`.

After completing any implementation, review, planning, or integration task,
tell the user:

- what changed
- what was verified
- whether separate review is required and why
- the commit hash, unless a stop condition prevented committing
- what to do next
- the exact prompt to paste into the next chat, based on `.agents/NEXT.md` and `.agents/WORKFLOW.md`

Use `.agents/` for temporary or frequently changing work such as:

- roadmap snapshots
- backlog grooming
- epic breakdowns
- task briefs
- role prompts
- implementation handoffs
- review notes
- proposed decisions

Do not put durable product, architecture, design, security, API, deployment, or
contribution rules only in `.agents/`. Promote long-lived decisions back into
root documentation when they become stable.
